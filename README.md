FienDE Desktop Environment - GNOME1 Fork


!! This codebase is largely obsolete. DO NOT USE on a production system. !!

This is a continuous work to fork the GNOME 1 source code and get it to compile and work on a modern Linux/GNU system.

Please note that as it sits right now, you cannot compile it completely and get it to work. The GTK/GTK+ libraries are the holdup, and some work to clean it up has been done already, but it is far from complete.
